    //  Prologue. -Gonzalo wins golden spatula but ricardo looks upset/jealous
    //

    //  1. gonzalo and ricardo fight as ricardo steals the spatula
    //G: Ricardo! What are you doing?!
    //G: That Golden Spatula is mine!
    //R: Ay dios mio, just get a regular spatula.
    //R: You would use this to cook anyway, we both know you'd just frame it on the wall and never use it.
    //G: ...that's what trophies are for, Ricardo. To sit on the shelf.
    //G: *gasp* Are you saying that you were thinking of using that Spatula to actually cook?!
    //R: Uhh...
    //R: I guess I should leave now.
    //G: No! Ricardo!
    //G: I have to get the Golden Spatula back!

    //  2. gonzalo tells papa alfonso
    //G: ...!
    //G: Papa Alfonso! Mamma mia, it really is you!
    //A: ...Huh?? Who's there?
    //G: Papa, it's me! Your son Gonzalo! You showed up at the right time, I really need your advice!
    //A: Whatsa say sonnie??
    //G: Do you remember papa? When I was younger and you'd teach me all kinds of tricks in the kitchen? I wanted to make you feel proud of me papa...
    //G: I won the Golden Spatula papa, but that wicked Ricardo stole it away from me!
    //G: He's probably using it to cook right now! He's going to get it dirty!
    //A: A little bit louder sonnie!
    //G: ...You're right.
    //G: I shouldn't just sit here, I should go take it back from him! At all costs!
    //G: Thank you, papa Alfonso. You're my hero.
    //G: I'm going to take the Golden Spatula back and make you proud!
    //A: ...
    //A: ...What a weird kiddo.

    //  3. gonzalo must get the keys to ricardo's kitchen
    //G: Right, so Ricardo must be locked up in his kitchen right now...
    //G: That means I should find the keys to his kitchen!
    //G: But where would Ricardo place his keys?
    //G: ...Guess I'll look around.

    //  4. gonzalo drops the keys in salsa
    //G: !
    //G: Mamma mia! The keys!
    //G: I have to get them back!

    //  5. boss fight vs ricardo
    //G: This is it, Ricardo.
    //G: You shall get away with this no more!
    //R: Oh, it's you, my dear friend Gonzalo...
    //R: It took you quite a while to find me, I was starting to lose hope.
    //G: Mamma mia, can you believe it? On my way here, I found a giant pot filled with tomato salsa, and I accidentally dropped your kitchen's keys in it, and had to dive in there to get them back--
    //R: You
    //R: You did what
    //G: Huh?
    //R: Huh?
    //G: Well, whatever. That Spatula is mine and you know it, Ricardo!
    //G: I shall take it back!
    //R: Then perish.
